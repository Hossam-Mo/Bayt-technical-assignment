## There are two files

rss
server

note: I didn't send the node_modules file so you need to install the npm dependencies for both of the files.
you need to go to the file and run
npm install
it will install all dependencies
please do this for both of the files

rss is the client side
I used React js to create the web page
to run the React js file just go to the file and use this command in the terminal...
npm start

....

the server file is a Node js and Express API
to run it use this command
npm run start
